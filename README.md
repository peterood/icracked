To submit a repair request, the user navigates through our "Repair Flows" at:
www.icracked.com/repair

The Project

Using these API endpoints, re-create the functional aspects of the Repair Flow.

- You can use any front-end web technologies that you want.
- Only focus on the buttons in the flow (e.g. iPhone, iPad, Samsung), and the headers (e.g.
"What Model iPhone?")
- Do Not spend any time working on the visual aspects of the flow.
- Also do not spend any time accessory features, ex. modals, breadcrumbs, or navigation.
- Bonus points if the URL changes appropriately.
